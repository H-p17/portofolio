# Portfolio Website Development TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create public index.html with responsive structure (Home, About, Projects, Contact sections for visitors)
- [x] Create admin.html with CRUD functionality using localStorage (add, edit, delete projects with images, links, descriptions)
- [x] Create styles.css with aesthetic design (dark theme, gradients, animations, responsive)
- [x] Create script.js for admin CRUD operations
- [x] Create public.js for loading projects on public page
- [x] Implement Bootstrap for responsiveness and UI components
- [x] Add smooth scrolling and fade-in animations
- [x] Separate public viewing and admin CRUD areas

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test the public homepage locally (open index.html in browser)
- [ ] Test the admin page locally (open admin.html in browser)
- [ ] Customize content (replace placeholder text and images)
- [ ] Optimize for performance (minify CSS/JS if needed)
- [ ] Add more features if required (e.g., contact form functionality)

## Notes
- Website is static, uses localStorage for data persistence (shared between public and admin)
- Public page (index.html) for visitors to view portfolio
- Admin page (admin.html) for managing projects (CRUD)
- Easy to host on any static hosting service
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
